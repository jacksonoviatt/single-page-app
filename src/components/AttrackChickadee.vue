        <h3>How to attract chickadees</h3>
        <p>
        The best way to attract a Black-capped Chickadee to your yard is to purchase a bird feeder. Some of the feeders they've been known to frequent are tube feeders, hopper feeders, platform feeders and suet feeders. Black-capped Chickadees will eat black oil sunflower seeds, peanuts and suet.
