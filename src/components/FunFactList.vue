    <h3>Fun Facts About Chickadees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chickadees usually mate for life.</li>
      <li>
        Only about 20% of the Black-cappedâ€™s daily energy intake comes from
        feeders, and about half of the overall winter diet is made up of such
        animal matter as spiders, dormant insects, and even carrion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chickadees are a tough little bird that do not migrate. During cold
        weather Chickadees have been found to need twenty times more food than
        they do in summer.
      </li>
      <li>Chickadees weigh less than one-half of an ounce.</li>
      <li>
        Chickadees can gain as much as 10 percent of their body weight each day
        and lose it all again during a cold winter night.
